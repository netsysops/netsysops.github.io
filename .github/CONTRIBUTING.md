# Helping out

Want to contribute to the project? Perhaps you've found a typo or some other error. Please submit [a new issue](https://github.com/netsysops/netsysops.github.io/issues/new) or send in a [pull request](https://github.com/netsysops/netsysops.github.io/pulls).

You can also use the issues to suggest content that you would like to read or to write yourself and contribute to the project.

Aside from working with this GitHub repo there are also other ways to [help the project](https://www.netsysops.io/contribute/).

## When contributing

In order to avoid broken links, and make sure the site looks nice when sharing on social media there are a few tests which have to pass before a PR will be considered. More information about these tests will be added later, for now you can take a look in the [.travis.yml](https://github.com/netsysops/netsysops.github.io/blob/master/.travis.yml) file and work from there. Create an issue if you are unsure about what to do.

The controls on the content is more strict for articles which are part of a longer guide or a tutorial like the ones in the [Principles of network automation](https://www.netsysops.io/principles/), the [Skills](https://www.netsysops.io/skills/) or the [Toolkit](https://www.netsysops.io/toolkit/). One such check is the existence of a header teaser image. An example in Patrick Ogenstads [profile page](https://github.com/netsysops/netsysops.github.io/blob/master/_pages/ogenstad.md) looks like this:

``` yaml

header:
  teaser: /assets/images/patrick-ogenstad-600x400.jpg

```

The header teaser image won't be enforced on blog articles.
